# menu_temp — throwaway menu gallery

Ten designs for the installer's config picker. Nothing here is wired into
`install.sh`; delete the folder when you have picked one.

```bash
bash ~/dotfiles/menu_temp/demo.sh        # gallery — pick, try, come back
bash ~/dotfiles/menu_temp/demo.sh 6      # jump straight to one
bash ~/dotfiles/menu_temp/demo.sh all    # all ten in a row
```

Inside a design: `enter` toggles, `ctrl-a` selects all, `ctrl-j` confirms,
`esc` skips. What you picked is printed after it closes.

| # | Design | Idea |
|---|--------|------|
| 1 | classic+ | today's menu tightened — border label, footer keys, inline count |
| 2 | preview | details pane on the right: package, stow target, state, files |
| 3 | grouped | headings — terminals / shells / desktop / tools |
| 4 | cards | two-line entries with a divider between them |
| 5 | state | right-hand column: already installed vs new |
| 6 | wizard | full screen, every section boxed, "step 1 of 3" |
| 7 | minimal | no boxes, one rule, ghost text, air |
| 8 | plan pane | bottom pane showing the steps that config will run |
| 9 | banner | ASCII wordmark inside the frame, above the list |
| 10 | live cart | selections collect in a pane on the right as you toggle |

They combine — 2+3, or 5+6, or 9 on top of anything.

## Before adopting one

`--footer`, `--style`, `--list-label`, `--ghost` and `--gap-line` are fzf 0.6x+.
This machine has 0.74, but Debian 12 ships 0.38 and Ubuntu 22.04 ships 0.29, so
whatever wins needs a version check in `fzf_pick` with the plain flags as the
fallback — the installer already installs fzf, it just cannot guarantee a recent
one from apt.
